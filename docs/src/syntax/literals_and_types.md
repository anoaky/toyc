# Literals 

Akyno has three kinds of literals: integers, characters, and strings. For example:

```akyno
23
'a'
"Hello, world!"
```

are all valid strings.

# Types

The three literals above have type `int`, `char`, and `&char`, respectively. `int` and `char` are the only two base types currently available; prepending an `&` signifies a pointer type.
